# Repository for studying Lightning 2.0 :zap:

## Have been Ineterested in Lightning since Sep, 2022. (= before Lightning 2.0 launch)
- Studying in NLP, I hust heard about 'Pytorch Lightning' in 2022. However,there was a chance to experience 'Pytorch Lightning⚡' in September, 2022. It was much easier for me to write code, and readbility of pytorch lightning code was better than pytorch. :smirk:
- Recently, `Pytorch 2.0` and `Lightning⚡ 2.0` launched at the same day! Since I have used `Pytorch 2.0` `nightly version` since June, 2022, it was not surpirse for me to `Pytorch 2.0` launch, but `Lightning⚡ 2.0 :zap:` was surprise to me. :star_struck:
- There seems many things to learn or use in `Lightning⚡ 2.0`. This repository is for learning or studying `Lightning⚡ 2.0`.
